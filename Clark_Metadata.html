	<p>The boys are named Calum, Michael, Luke, and Michael. They are all Australian. 
Let me say one thing, THEY ARE NOT A BOY BAND!! Boy bands don't write their own music or
play their own instruments.</p>
<!--end paragraph-->
	<p>Luke Hemmings is the lead singer of the band. He is also the baby at 21 years old.
He plays the guitar and sings, writes, and does high jumps on stage!</p>
<!--end paragraph-->
	<p>Calum Hood is the bassist and singer. He is 22 years old, an Aquarius,
 and his sister, Mali-Koa, is also a singer</p>

	<p>Ashton Irwin is the drummer and back up vocals. Personally, I think he is underrated
 because he works so hard. He grew up in a 'broken home' as his father was separated
  from him. He is known as the dad of the band since he is the oldest.</p>
	<p>Michael Clifford is a singer and guitarist in 5 Seconds of Summer. He is a Scorpio. 
He is a bit clumsy, as he falls off stage a lot and he burnt his hair 
from it catching on fire.</p>
